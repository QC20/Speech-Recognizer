# Speech-Recognizer
Small Python Code Snippet to Transcribe Your Voice via Microphone


# Prototype for Voice User Interfaces (VUI) - README
This project is a prototype for voice user interfaces (VUI) and demonstrates the integration of speech recognition technology. It explores the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and interaction design by allowing users to interact with a system using spoken commands.

The code snippet provided below demonstrates the basic functionality of the project. It utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to recognize speech input from the user through a microphone. The recognized speech is then processed and printed as text.

To use this code, make sure you have the SpeechRecognition library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
